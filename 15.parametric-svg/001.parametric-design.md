参数化设计是用参数和规则来表达设计意图与展示结果直接的关系。

Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.


The term parametric originates from mathematics (parametric equation 参数方程) and refers to the use of certain parameters or variables that can be edited to manipulate or alter the end result of an equation or system.
